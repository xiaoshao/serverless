# Documentation

This docs section will include documentation relevant to understand how Serverless works.

You may want to start with the ["Your first service"](/docs/tutorials/your-first-service.md) tutorial to create, deploy,
invoke and remove your very first Serverless service!

If you're interested to take a look behind the scenes you might take a look at the [concepts](/docs/concepts) of
Serverless to understand the how Serverless is architected and works.

After that you should take a look at the different [plugins](/docs/plugins) which are used to deliver the functionality
Serverless provides (such as service creation, deployment, removal, function invocation etc.).
